# SandSnap: Citizen Science Beach Grain Size

> This website is new and still under development, but please email daniel {at} mardascience {dot} com and I would be happy to talk with you!

The US Army Corps of Engineers, James Madison University, Marda Science, LLC and USGS have partnered together in an endeavor to develop a way to collect beach grain size information using citizen scientists armed with their cell phone and any US coin. We need beach sediment samples and images from all over the United States to test out processing techniques and your help will be quite valuable!

See the [website](https://cirp.usace.army.mil/workunits/citizen_beach.php) and the [webapp](https://sandsnap-erdcchl.hub.arcgis.com/)

### Find the coin to scale the image

Image segmentation model outputs:

### Use SediNet to estimate the grain size

Read about SediNet in [the paper](../../static/papers/Buscombe_SediNet_submission.pdf) 

Find the source code on our [company github site](https://github.com/MARDAScience)

### We are experts in estimating grain size from imagery

Our other technique uses wavelets and doesnt need to be trained. See the [paper](../../static/papers/Buscombe_2013_sedimentology_10.1111-sed.12049.pdf) and check out the souce code on [Dan's github site](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/pyDGS)
